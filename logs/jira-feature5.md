h1. Task: Review Current Lambda Logs and Align with Logging Standards

h2. Description
Conduct a comprehensive review of existing Lambda function logs to identify gaps between current logging practices and the organization's logging standards. Assess the format, fields, and consistency of logs to create a detailed plan for bringing them into compliance with the new standardized logging approach.

h3. Epic Link
Implement Comprehensive Logging Strategy for AWS Services

h2. Sub-tasks
# Export sample logs from each Lambda function for analysis
# Document current logging patterns, formats, and fields being used
# Identify inconsistencies across different Lambda functions
# Compare current logging practices against organizational standards
# Create an inventory of missing required fields across functions
# Assess current log levels and their appropriate usage
# Identify instances where sensitive data might be logged
# Check for correlation ID implementation or gaps
# Evaluate current error handling and error logging patterns
# Document performance implications of current logging

h2. Acceptance Criteria
# Comprehensive documentation of current logging state across all Lambda functions
# Gap analysis comparing current state vs. target state
# Prioritized list of changes needed for each Lambda function
# Identification of any sensitive data currently being logged
# Estimate of effort required to bring each function into compliance
# Sample code snippets demonstrating required changes
# Implementation plan with recommendations for phased approach

h2. Notes
This task should be completed early in the epic as it will inform the specific implementation details for standardized application logging. The findings will help refine the scope and approach for the overall logging strategy implementation.
