h2. Tasks
# Research Lambda Powertools metrics capabilities
# Create proof of concept with custom metrics for:
## Request count by API endpoint
## Error count by service
## Latency percentiles (p50, p90, p99)
# Test CloudWatch alarm creation on custom metrics
# Document implementation patterns for the team

h2. Expected Outcomes
* Documented approach for implementing custom metrics
* Sample code for metrics implementation
* Performance impact assessment of metrics collection
* Guidelines for metric naming and dimensions
