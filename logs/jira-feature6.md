h1. Task: Align Lambda Logs with Organizational Standards

h2. Description
Implement changes to align all Lambda function logging with the organization's standardized logging format and fields as defined in our logging standards. This task involves modifying existing logging implementations to ensure consistency, proper formatting, and inclusion of all required fields while excluding sensitive data.

Implement Comprehensive Logging Strategy for AWS Services

h3. Depends On
Review Current Lambda Logs and Align with Logging Standards

h2. Sub-tasks
# Update logging utility functions to match standardized format
# Modify Lambda functions to use consistent logging approach
# Implement required standard fields (to be determined based on review findings)
# Remove any sensitive data from logs
# Add appropriate log levels to all logging statements
# Ensure correlation ID is included in all log entries
# Standardize error logging across all functions
# Add context information to logs (service name, environment, etc.)
# Test updated logging to verify compliance with standards
# Update documentation to reflect changes

h2. Acceptance Criteria
# All Lambda functions use the standardized logging format
# Required fields are present in all log entries
# No sensitive data is included in logs
# Log levels are appropriately applied across all functions
# Logs are properly formatted as JSON for easier querying
# Error logging provides sufficient context for troubleshooting
# Correlation IDs are consistently implemented
# Logging changes do not negatively impact performance

h2. Notes
The specific implementation details will be determined based on the findings from the log review task. This task should be undertaken only after the review is complete and the specific required changes have been identified.
