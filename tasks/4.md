h1. Extend system testing for versioned api routes

h2. Description
We need to extend our existing behave system testing, to cover the newly implemented versioned API routes (/v1/* and /v2/*). These tests will verify that both versions of the API respond correctly to requests and deliver the expected response structures according to their specifications.

To be discussed prior to including in sprint:
* The existing tests all used non-prefixed requests, this can be left alone, or updated to a 'v1' prefix
* We will need to extend the context setup to handle version-specific API clients
* Consider parameterising tests to avoid duplication between version tests
* May need to update testing utilities to handle the new structured response format

h3. Objectives
* Create new Behave feature files for the affected /v2 API routes ('/execute')
* Verify that both versions return the expected response structures
* Ensure existing tests are still backward compatibile (/v1 routes)

h2. Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] Behave feature files exist for testing all critical endpoints in both /v1 and /v2 routes
* [ ] Tests verify that /v2 endpoints include the new "targets" data
* [ ] Error handling scenarios are covered for both versions

h2. Dependencies
* Depends on completion of "api routers" task
* Depends on completion of "response model strategy" task
