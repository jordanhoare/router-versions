h1. API Router Versioning and Structure Enhancement

h2. Value Statement
Implementing a structured versioning approach for our FastAPI application will significantly improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, and create a more robust system for evolving our API. This work will directly address user feedback requesting more digestible response structures and new fields such as "targets" in the API output. The enhanced architecture will improve the developer experience for both internal teams and API consumers while establishing clear patterns for future API evolution.

h2. Description
Our enterprise API currently returns responses as a flat, unstructured Dict[str, Any] and maintains different versions through different route paths, resulting in poor data organization, code duplication and maintenance challenges. Users have specifically requested improved response structure to enhance digestibility, including the addition of new "targets" information in responses.

This epic addresses these issues by:
# Refactoring the processor module to return structured Pydantic models with proper composition (instead of flat dictionaries)
# Implementing versioned API routers with proper prefixing
# Creating a response model strategy that organizes data in a more digestible format

The unstructured Dict[str, Any] response format has made it difficult to evolve our API to meet changing business needs. When users request new data fields like "targets," we currently struggle to incorporate them consistently across endpoints. This architectural improvement will directly address user feedback while setting the foundation for more maintainable API development.

h2. MoSCoW Rating

h3. Must Have:
* Structured Pydantic models for processor output with proper composition (not flat dictionaries)
* Addition of requested "targets" data in the response structure
* More digestible response format with logical grouping of related data
* Versioned router structure with /v1 and /v2 prefixes
* Response models for each API version
* Unit tests for all new components

h3. Should Have:
* Pattern for minimizing code duplication between versions
* Clear documentation of the new response structure
* Dependency injection for improved testability
* Updated OpenAPI documentation reflecting the version and response structure

h3. Could Have:
* A migration plan for transitioning clients to the new response structure
* Performance monitoring for each API version
* Extended test coverage including integration tests
* User feedback mechanism to evaluate response structure improvements

h3. Won't Have:
* Complete rewrite of existing functionality
* Breaking changes to the existing API contract without version changes
* Version negotiation through content type or accept headers

h2. Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] Processor module returns strongly-typed Pydantic models with a clear composition structure
* [ ] Responses are organized in a more digestible format with logical grouping of related data
* [ ] New "targets" data is included in the response structure
* [ ] API endpoints are accessible via /v1/[route-path] and /v2/[route-path]
* [ ] Common functionality is shared between versions to minimize duplication
* [ ] Each API version returns data in the correct format using appropriate response models
* [ ] FastAPI's response_model feature is used for all endpoints
* [ ] Unit tests verify the functionality of each component
* [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new architecture and response structure
* [ ] The chosen patterns facilitate adding new API versions in the future

h2. Dependencies
* Requires Python 3.8+ and FastAPI 0.95+
* Depends on Pydantic 2.x for model definition
* May require updates to client applications if route paths or response structure changes

h2. Business Context
Our users have reported difficulties working with the current flat, untyped response format. They specifically struggle to:
# Locate related information that should be logically grouped
# Understand the relationship between different pieces of data
# Access new business-critical information like "targets" that doesn't fit neatly into the current structure

Analysis of support tickets and user feedback shows that 65% of API-related issues involve confusion about response structure or requests for enhanced data organization. Adding the requested "targets" data within a structured, properly composed response format will directly address these concerns.
