h2. Description
Currently, different API versions are maintained using different route paths. We need to transition to a more structured approach using versioned routers that share the same route paths but with different version prefixes (/v1, /v2). This will make the API more RESTful and consistent while reducing code duplication between versions.

h3. Objectives
* Create a versioned router structure with /v1 and /v2 prefixes
* Maintain the same route paths across versions for consistent API design
* Minimize duplication of route handler code between versions
* Implement a strategy for easy testing of each version
* Provide a pattern that makes adding future versions straightforward

h3. Implementation Suggestions
Various implementation patterns have been discussed:

*1. Shared Route Functions Pattern*:
* Create common route handlers used by multiple versions
* Each version only implements handlers that differ from common functionality

*2. Router Factory Pattern*:
* Create a factory function that generates routers with common routes
* Version-specific routers add or override routes as needed

*3. Class-Based Router Inheritance Pattern*:
* Create a base router class with common functionality
* Version-specific routers inherit and override only what's different
* Offers strong testability through dependency injection

*4. Decorator-Based Versioning*:
* Use decorators to apply the same handler to multiple version routes
* Good for routes that are identical across all versions

The team should evaluate which pattern best fits our needs for maintainability and testability.

h3. Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] API endpoints are accessible via /v1/[route-path] and /v2/[route-path]
* [ ] Common functionality is shared between versions to minimize duplication
* [ ] Version-specific behavior is clearly separated from common behavior
* [ ] Code structure facilitates thorough testing of each version
* [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the versioned API structure
* [ ] OpenAPI documentation correctly reflects the versioned endpoints

h3. Technical Considerations
* This change will affect how clients access our API
* Consider adding a deprecation period for the old route structure
* Ensure API documentation clearly explains the version differences
* Make sure monitoring and logging capture version information
