h2. Description
We need a consistent approach for transforming processor output into version-specific API responses. This task involves creating a structured way to define response models for each API version and implementing a pattern for transforming processor results into these response formats.

h3. Objectives
* Create version-specific Pydantic response models
* Implement a consistent transformation strategy from processor results to API responses
* Make use of FastAPI's response_model feature for automatic validation
* Ensure each API version returns the correct data structure
* Make it easy to add new API versions in the future

h3. Implementation Suggestions
Several approaches were discussed:

*1. Class Method Transformation*:
* Define from_processor_result() class methods on each response model
* Each model is responsible for transforming processor output into its format
* Simple and keeps transformation logic close to the model definition

*2. Adapter Pattern*:
* Create adapter classes that convert processor output to response models
* Provides more flexibility for complex transformations
* Useful when transformation logic is complex or shared

*3. Validator-Based Transformation*:
* Use Pydantic validators to transform fields during model creation
* Useful for simple transformations on individual fields

*4. Factory Pattern*:
* Create factory functions that build response models from processor results
* Centralizes transformation logic

The most promising approach seems to be the Class Method Transformation pattern for simplicity and maintainability, but the team should evaluate options based on our specific needs.

h3. Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] Version-specific response models are defined using Pydantic
* [ ] Each API version returns data in the correct format
* [ ] Transformation from processor output to response models is consistent
* [ ] FastAPI's response_model feature is used for all endpoints
* [ ] Unit tests verify each transformation produces the expected output
* [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the response model strategy

h3. Technical Debt Considerations
* This pattern will make it easier to maintain API versioning in the future
* Reduces the need for manual validation in endpoint handlers
* Makes API documentation more accurate through OpenAPI schema generation
* Will facilitate adding new API versions with minimal changes to existing code
