h2. Description
Currently, the processor module returns a deeply nested Dict[str, Any] without type definitions, making it difficult to work with across API versions. This task involves refactoring the processor module to return structured Pydantic models following a composition pattern, which will make the output more predictable and easier to transform for different API versions.

h3. Objectives
* Transition away from untyped Dict[str, Any] to structured Pydantic models
* Implement a composition-based schema for processor output
* Maintain backward compatibility with existing code
* Improve type hinting and IDE support
* Make it easier to transform processor output for different API versions

h3. Implementation Suggestions
# Create a set of Pydantic models to represent processor output:
** Base information model (process ID, status, timestamp)
** Component details model (containing items with metadata)
** Metrics model for performance data
** Complete ProcessorResult model composing all of the above

# Refactor the processor module to use these models:
** Update the process_data method to return the new model structure
** Maintain backward compatibility by including a raw_data field if needed

# Consider these design patterns:
** Composition over inheritance for models
** Immutable models where possible
** Factory methods for creating standard responses

h3. Potential Approaches
Several implementation patterns were discussed:
* Direct Pydantic model usage
* Class-based inheritance with composition
* Factory pattern

The team will evaluate which pattern best fits our needs based on testability, maintainability, and simplicity.

h3. Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] Processor module returns strongly-typed Pydantic models
* [ ] Models follow a composition pattern with clear hierarchy
* [ ] All current functionality is preserved
* [ ] Backward compatibility is maintained
* [ ] Unit tests cover the new model structure
* [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new model structure

h3. Technical Debt Considerations
* This will simplify future API versioning work
* Will reduce the need for type checking and validation in endpoints
* May necessitate updates to any code that directly accesses the processor output
